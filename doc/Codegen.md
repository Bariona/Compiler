Virtual Register: actually is memory.



*For convenience, we only use `lw` , `sw` instructions, which requires `bool`'s size to be 4 bytes.



### Code generation

We only uses several register, say `ra`, `sp`, `fp`, `a0`...

Other values will only be stored in the memory.

### procedure

f:

callee store (e.g. ra/sp...)

​	$\vdots$

​	caller store

​	call g

​	caller load

callee load



s0/fp: (frame pointer) always points to the top of current frame

sp: (stack pointer) always points to the top of the stack

ra: (return address) stores return address

#### pseudo instruction

- call: `jalr x1, offset[11:0](x1)` 

  jump and stores `ra`

- ret:  `jalr x0, 0(x1)` 

  return to `ra`'s location



`.size`: This directive sets the size associated with a symbol `name`. The size in bytes is computed from `expression` which can make use of label arithmetic.

`.p2align`: For example .p2align 3 advances the location counter until it a multiple of 8. If the location counter is already a multiple of 8, no change is needed. 

`.text`:  is a read-only section containing executable code

`.data`:  is a read-write section containing global or static variables

`.bss`:  is a read-write section containing *uninitialized* data

`.type`: used to set the type of a symbol

`.rodata`: Directive: enter read-only data section

### The Stack Pointer (sp)

​	We treat the stack as a big array, with a special register – the stack pointer – that points at some location. All locations beyond the stack pointer are considered to be garbage, and all locations **before** the stack pointer are considered to be allocated. The stack usually **grows only at the entry to a function**, by an increment large enough to hold all the local variables for that function, and, just before the exit from the function, shrinks by the same amount.

- For historical reasons, run-time stacks usually start at a high memory address and grow toward smaller addresses.

### The Frame Pointer (fp)

 	Suppose a function $g(. . .)$ calls the function $f (a_1,..., a_n)$. We say g is the $caller$ and f is the $callee$. On entry to $f$ , the stack pointer points to the first argument that $g$ passes to $f$ . On entry, $f$ allocates a frame by simply subtracting the frame size from the stack pointer $SP$.

- After allocation (sub sp, size), the old sp now becomes the current fp (frame pointer), and the old fp will be store in memory.
- When $f$ exits, just copies fp back to sp and fetches back the saved fp.

### Parameter Passing

​	 Studies of actual programs have shown that very few functions have more than four arguments, and almost none have more than six.

​	Therefore, parameter-passing conventions for modern machines specify that the first $k$ arguments (for $k = 4$ or $k = 6$, typically) of a function are passed in registers $r_p, ...,r_{p+k−1}$, and the rest of the arguments are passed in memory.



### Return Address

​	When function $g$ calls function $f$ , eventually $f$ must return. It needs to know where to go back to. If the call instruction within g is at address a, then (usually) the right place to return to is a + 1, the next instruction in $g$. This is called the return address.
